# zDBA-SQL-Queries

This repository contains a curated collection of SQL Server queries used in my daily routine as a Senior Database Administrator. These scripts support various operational, auditing, and performance-related tasks across enterprise environments, particularly within secure and scalable onboarding frameworks.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document frequently used SQL queries for repeatable DBA tasks
- Share practical solutions for real-world database administration challenges
- Provide a reference for onboarding, auditing, optimization, and troubleshooting
- Enable future expansion with categorized and well-commented scripts

## 📁 Structure

Each query is stored as a standalone `.sql` file with descriptive filenames. The repository is organized to reflect common DBA task categories

> 📂 Additional folders or tags may be introduced as the repository grows.

## 🛠️ Usage

To use a query:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the desired `.sql` file in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
3. Review and adjust parameters (e.g., database name, date range) as needed.
4. Execute in a safe environment with appropriate permissions.

## 🚀 Future Additions

This repository is actively maintained and will expand to include:
- More categorized queries for automation and reporting
- Visual dashboards using T-SQL and Power BI integration
